/** \mainpage MCFSimplex Manual

\section intro Introduction
This file is a short user manual for our distribution of MCFSimplex a C++ 
implementation of the Primal and Dual Network Simplex algorithm for Linear 
and Quadratic Min Cost Flow problems.

\subsection disclaimer Standard Disclaimer

This code is provided "as is", without any explicit or implicit warranty
that it will properly behave or it will suit you needs. Although codes
reaching the distribution phase have usually been extensively tested, we
cannot guarantee that they are absolutely bug-free (who can?). Any use of
the codes is at you own risk: in no case we could be considered liable for
any damage or loss you would evenctually suffer, either directly or
indirectly, for having used this code. More details about the non-warranty
attached to this code are available in the license description file.

The code also comes with a "good will only" support: feel free to contact us
for any comments/critics/bug report/request help you may have, we will be
happy to try to answer and help you. But we cannot spend much time solving
your problems, just the time to read a couple of e-mails and send you fast
suggestions if the problem is easily solvable. Apart from that, we can't
offer you any support.

\subsection release Release

Current version of MCFSimplex is: 1.00 
Current date is: August 29, 2011


\section howto How to Use It

This release comes out with the following files:

- Manual This file.

- doc/LGPL.txt Description of the LGPL license

- doc/refman.pdf Pdf version of the full manual.

- doc/html/* Html version of the full manual.

- OPTUtils.h Contains some small utilities such as random number generators 
  and timing routines.

- MCFClass.h Contains the declaration of class MCFClass; it is an "abstract" 
  class with "pure virtual" methods, so that you cannot declare objects of 
  type MCFClass, but only of derived class of its. MCFClass offers a general 
  interface for MCF solver codes, with methods for setting and reading the 
  data of the problems, for solving it and retrieving solution informations, 
  and so on. The actual Min Cost Flow solver distributed in this package 
  conforms with the interface, i.e., it derives from MCFClass; however, the idea 
  is that applications using this interface would require almost no changes if 
  any other of the available solvers implementing the interface is used. 
  Carefully read the public interface of the class to understend how to use 
  the public methods of the class.

- MCFSimplex.h Contains the declarations of class MCFSimplex. Being a derived 
  class of MCFClass, most of its interface is defined and discussed in
  MCFClass.h;  however, some implementation dependent details (and compile-time
  switches)  which are worth knowing are described in this file.

- MCFSimplex.C Contains the implementation of the MCFSimplex class, which uses 
  the Primal or Dual Network Simplex algorithm to solve the Min Cost Flow
  problem. You should not need to read it.

The following files are not a part of the actual MCF solver, they are only
provided as an example of how to use it:

- Main.C Contains an example of use of MCFSimplex; it reads the data from a
  file in DIMACS standard format, constructs the problem, solves
  it and prints the results.

- sample.dmx An example of a tiny (4 nodes, 4 arcs) network in DIMACS
  standard format; the comments in the file also describe the
  format itself.

- sample.qdmx An example of tiny (4 nodes, 4 arcs) quadratic network in DIMACS 
  extended format; the comments in the file also describe the format itself.

- makefile A makefile of the example.

\subsection testing Testing the distribution

To compile the example, edit the makefile and do the proper changes (such
as the compiler name), then just type "make". To execute the example

MCFSolve sample.dmx

The output should be something like

Optimal Objective Function value = 9 
Solution time (s): user 0, system 0
